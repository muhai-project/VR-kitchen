# Description:
The MUHAI VR Kitchen is a virtual reality (VR) environment for interacting with a visual representation of a robotic cooking assistant.
This VR application is used to observe humans during cooperative cooking with an artificial partner and was developed for the Oculus Quest 2 and 3 HMD in the Unity game engine. In this application, the user is placed in a virtual kitchen containing a virtual robot. The objects in the kitchen can be interacted with using both hands or controllers. Various tasks can be completed by grabbing tools or ingredients and moving them in the correct way, e.g., tilting a bag of sugar to pour the contents into a bowl or moving a knife’s blade in a downward motion through an ingredient. Additionally, the robot can be ordered to fulfill any cooking tasks needed for recipe completion – e.g., mixing the ingredients in a bowl – as well as supporting actions such as cleaning surfaces, removing trash like vegetable peels, or fetching objects the user has requested.
These orders can be given through a delegation-type interface where the user can give the robot an order in a declarative manner but is not required to provide any details on how the task should be accomplished. This interface is affordance-based, meaning it shows the user the possible actions that the robot could accomplish using the chosen object. If an order is given that requires more than one parameter, all the other possible objects that could be used in combination are highlighted e.g. picking the action ``Portion ingredient'' used on a bag of flour will then highlight all possible target containers for the ingredient.
The VR environment is mirrored in the [abe_sim](https://github.com/mpomarlan/abe_sim) mental simulation and serves as an interface for it. A working installation of abe_sim as well as a Meta Quest VR Headset and a windows operating system are necessary to run the application.
